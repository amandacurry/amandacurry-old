				<p>Welcome to my blog! So why did I start a blog?
Throughout my life I have been told countless times to keep a work journal as good way to look back at challenges I overcame and see what I had achieved; but keeping a physical journal seems a bit ironic when I work in computing.
A blog, on the other hand, is an opportunity for me to document my projects not just for myself but also anyone else who has come across the same problems. And the first of those projects is... well, the blog itself.</p>
<h4>How I built this blog</h4>
<p>I am a real fan of simplicity so I really liked the idea of a static website. 
This blog was built using <a href = "http://blog.getpelican.com/"> Pelican </a>, a python-based static website generator. Why would you want a static site?
No faffing around with databases and servers means that your site will be more secure and you can host it pretty much anywhere - this one for example is hosted on GitHub.</p>
<p>Pelican takes pages written in <a href = "https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"> MarkDown </a> and outputs your plain html website. </p>
<p>So what are the main challenges I found? I wanted a form for my contact page rather than listing my contact details... But given that I wanted a static website more, I ended up embedding a Google form as per <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9533172/adding-contact-form-to-a-static-website"> this StackOveflow post </a>. 
Not as pretty but just as effective. Go on, try it.</p>
<p>Other than that Pelican is pretty straight forward. You can create your own theme to customise the look of your site - I have included Bootstrap in mine. I can definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good and easy way to build a blog or a site.</p>
<h4>Future Projects</h4>
<p>What can you expect to find in this blog in the near future? I came across a PSION organiser a little while ago that I want to play around with. Expect at least one post on this topic!</p>
<p>I have a few other projects in mind but they are not very concrete at the moment. In the meantime, feel free to check out the rest of the website and send me a message.</p>
